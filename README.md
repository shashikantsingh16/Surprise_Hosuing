## General Information
The Autralian company is looking to buy the house at lower value and then covert them to higer prices. We need to build a regression model using hosuing data with `Sale Price` as the `Target Variable` using the predictor variable and not diverting from the accuracy of the model. We also need to have the optimal value for ridge and lasso regression.

Business will get the idea of the prices and feature on which the price varries. Business can utilse these to meet the consumer demands and formulate the strategy againts the consumer behaviour to make it sellable and make profit.



## Conclusions
- Solving the overfitting issue in linear regression via regularization using Lasso and Ridge Regression.
- Finding the factors which are significant for the price change.
- Finding the factors which negetively impact the price change.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9
- Pandas 1.4.2
- Matplotlib 3.5.1
